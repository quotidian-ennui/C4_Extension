# C4_Extension
Coloring for https://github.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML

Using C4 diagrams in plantuml is great; but we're using it to denote systems that are actively under development and/or systems we want to retire. In effect a town plan of our internal product landscape and how they link to each other.

* Just defines some new colours for `System_new` and `System_Legacy`
* Adds a legend that just cares about systems.
